Launch configuration and other consideration
1. Use instance type t2.medium
2. Since you will be downloading the application archive from an S3 Bucket, 
    you'll need to create an IAM Role that allows your instances to use the S3 Service.
 
 3.  Keep http Port: 80 open

Steps to follow:
 
--->For network:

1) First, create a VPC

2) Next, 1 public subnet per availabilty zone (actually do we need a public subnet?)

3) 1 private subnet per availability zone (servers will be created here, 2 per subnet)

4) natgateway, route table

---->For servers:

1) security group for load balancer

2) security group for web server

3) InstanceProfile

3) a LaunchConfiguration with the instanceprofile attached

4) autoscaling group for the private subnet instances

5) a loadbalancer

6) a listener for the load balancer

7) health check
